        <h2>Bath is more nice town in Somerset!</h2>
        <div class="points">
            <p class="points-info">The city became a spa with the Latin name Aquae Sulis ("the waters of Sulis") c.
                60 AD when the
                Romans
                built baths and a
                temple in the valley of the River Avon, although hot springs were known even before then.</p>

            <p class="points-info">Many of the streets and squares were laid out by John Wood, the Elder, and in the
                18th century the
                city
                became
                fashionable and the population grew.</p>

            <p class="points-info">Bath has up to 1.3 million yearly visitors, making it one of ten English cities
                visited most by
                overseas
                tourists.</p>
